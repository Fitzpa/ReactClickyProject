# React Clicky Memory Game (Harry Potter Theme)

## This app displays a collection of Harry Potter images and asks the user to click one of the images. Each time the user clicks an image the collection of images shuffles and you have to remember or guess which images you have not clicked yet. Each time you click one that you have not clicked yet your score increments by one. If you click an image that you had previously clicked, your score goes back to zero and you have to start over. There is also a high-score feature that has been included.

## React was used to build this app. 
## Netlify was used to deploy this app.
